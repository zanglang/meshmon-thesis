	next-generation wireless networking. Because of their advantages

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the ability of a wireless mesh architecture to
	provide high performance Internet access while demanding little deployment
	planning or operational management. The architecture considered in
	this paper has unplanned node placement (rather than planned topology),
	omni-directional antennas (rather than directional links), and multi-hop
	routing (rather than single-hop base stations). These design decisions
	contribute to ease of deployment, an important requirement for community
	wireless networks. However, this architecture carries the risk that
	lack of planning might render the network's performance unusably
	low. For example, it might be necessary to place nodes carefully
	to ensure connectivity; the omni-directional antennas might provide
	uselessly short radio ranges; or the inefficiency of multi-hop forwarding
	might leave some users effectively disconnected.The paper evaluates
	this unplanned mesh architecture with a case study of the Roofnet
	802.11b mesh network. Roofnet consists of 37 nodes spread over four
	square kilometers of an urban area. The network provides users with
	usable performance despite lack of planning: the average inter-node
	throughput is 627 kbits/second, even though the average route has
	three hops.The paper evaluates multiple aspects of the architecture:
	the effect of node density on connectivity and throughput; the characteristics
	of the links that the routing protocol elects to use; the usefulness
	of the highly connected mesh afforded by omni-directional antennas
	for robustness and throughput; and the potential performance of a
	single-hop network using the same nodes as Roofnet.},

  abstract = {There is a fair amount of evidence that mesh (static multihop wireless)
	networks are gaining popularity, both in the academic literature
	and in the commercial space. Nonetheless, none of the prior work
	has evaluated the feasibility of applications on mesh through the
	use of deployed networks and real user traffic. The state of the
	art is the use of deployed testbeds with synthetic traces consisting
	of random traffic patterns.In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility
	of a mesh network for an all-wireless office using traces of office
	users and an actual 21-node multi-radio mesh testbed in an office
	area. Unlike previous mesh studies that have examined routing design
	in detail, we examine how different office mesh design choices impact
	the performance of user traffic. From our traces of 11 users spanning
	over a month, we identify 3 one hour trace periods with different
	characteristics and evaluate network performance for them. In addition,
	we consider different user-server placement, different wireless hardware,
	different wireless settings and different routing metrics.We find
	that our captured traffic is significantly different from the synthetic
	workloads typically used in the prior work. Our trace capture and
	replay methodology allows us to directly quantify the feasibility
	of office meshes by measuring the additional delay experienced by
	individual transactions made by user applications. Performance on
	our mesh network depends on the routing metric chosen, the user-server
	placement and the traffic load period. The choice of wireless hardware
	and wireless settings has a significant impact on performance under
	heavy load and challenging placement. Ultimately we conclude that
	for our traces and deployed system, under most conditions, all-wireless
	office meshes are feasible. In most cases, individual transactions
	incur under 20ms of additional delay over the mesh network. We believe
	this is an acceptable delay for most applications where a wired network
	to every machine is not readily available. We argue that our results
	are scalable to a network of over 100 users.},

  abstract = {Network management in multihop wireless networks is key to efficient
	and reliable network operation. In this paper, we focus on a part
	of the general network management problem, namely fault detection,

	trace-driven simulation as a diagnostic tool for detecting faults
	and performing root cause analysis. We apply our system to diagnose
	faults such as packet dropping, link congestion, MAC misbehavior,
	and external noise, and show that it yields reasonably accurate results.
	In addition, we show that our system can be used to evaluate alternative
	network and node configurations to improve performance of on-going
	long-lived flows. Moreover, our technique is general enough to be
	applied in other wireless and wireline network management system.},

	and robust protocol implementations, multi-hop mobile networks are
	witnessing widespread deployment. The monitoring of such networks
	is crucial for their robust operation. To this end, this paper presents
	DAMON, a distributed system for monitoring multi-hop mobile networks.
	DAMON uses agents within the network to monitor network behavior
	and send collected measurements to data repositories. DAMON's generic
	architecture supports the monitoring of a wide range of protocol,
	device, and network parameters. Other key features of DAMON include
	seamless support for multiple repositories, auto-discovery of sinks
	by the agents, and resiliency of agents to repository failures. We
	have implemented DAMON agents that collect statistics on data traffic
	and the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol.
	We have used our implementation to monitor an ad hoc network at the
	58th Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting held November
	2003 in Minneapolis, MN. In this paper, we describe the architecture
	of DAMON and report on the performance of the IETF network using
	monitoring information collected by DAMON. Our network monitoring
	system is available online for use by other researchers.},

	management challenging. As a remedy, we propose the ATMA framework,
	a framework which enables out-of-band management by deploying a multihop
	mesh network alongside a testbed to manage the latter. The ATMA mesh
	network is designed to be self-configuring and therefore can be installed
	with minimal effort. As an extension of the ATMA framework to multi-hop
	wireless testbeds, we have designed and developed a suite of tools
